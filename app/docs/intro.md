Roscoe Studio — Work Index

Roscoe Studio is a multi-disciplinary practice producing work across murals, digital design, sports artwork, and applied craft.
This page acts as a living catalog — a continuous, scrollable archive of projects, processes, experiments, and commissions.

Each project represents a moment in the studio’s ongoing exploration of surface, material, identity, and narrative.

This index collects the full range of Roscoe Studio output:

Murals

Large-scale painted environments, interior installations, exterior public works, and fast-execution event murals.

Digital

Brand systems, campaign visuals, UI art, editorial compositions, and mixed-media digital studies.

Sports

Professional team collaborations, athlete portraits, arena graphics, posters, and gameday artwork.

Applied

Airbrush apparel, live activation builds, custom-painted objects, installations, and functional art pieces.

Each project is documented with images, process captures, brief notes, and contextual details when relevant.

Navigation Style (MSDS Inspired)

Just like MSDS:
	•	Projects are displayed in a tight grid — uniform spacing, minimal color, image-first.
	•	Project titles are short — often just the name of the client or the concept.
	•	Each thumbnail leads to a project detail page, which is mostly images, supported by a short description.
	•	No clutter. No heavy UI.
Just a clean visual archive.

Page Structure Overview

Here’s the recommended structure for your actual page layout (to help you build it):

1. Intro (very short, MSDS-style)

Roscoe Studio is an interdisciplinary Boston practice working across mural art, digital design, sports graphics, and applied craft.

2. Project Grid (primary content)

A masonry or even-grid layout with:
	•	featured image
	•	short title
	•	service tag
	•	year (optional)

Example items:
	•	“South Station Mural — Mural”
	•	“Boston Pro Team Visuals — Sports”
	•	“Digital Icon Set — Digital”
	•	“Custom Airbrush Jackets — Applied”

3. Filter Bar (silent, minimal)
	•	All
	•	Murals
	•	Sports
	•	Digital
	•	Applied

(Exactly how MSDS has a simple “All / Interiors / Furniture / Products” taxonomy.)

4. Infinite scroll or paginated load

So users can browse without leaving the flow.

Tone & Voice (MSDS but Roscoe)

Minimal. Confident. Descriptive without being verbose.

Sample text for the top of your index:

Roscoe Studio produces work at a range of scales, from public murals and sports graphics to digital design systems and applied craft.
This index catalogues ongoing explorations in material, color, identity, movement, and narrative across disciplines.

✅ The Payload schema for Projects + Services needed to drive this index

✅ The frontend project grid layout in Tailwind, Framer Motion, or CSS grid

✅ A minimal MSDS-style design system (type, spacing, layout rules)
